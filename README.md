PythonImproved
==============

A better, improved `Python.tmLanguage` for Sublime Text and TextMate. Inspired by:

- the orginal TextMate and Sublime Text 2 `.tmLanguage` definitions
- facelessuser's [Better Python](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-languages)
- Djaniero's [Django syntax](https://github.com/squ1b3r/Djaneiro)

as well as a number of my own changes to make things more consistent and understandable. For customized syntax highlighting taking advantage of all the new scopes, use PythonImproved with the [Neon Color Scheme](https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-color-scheme).
